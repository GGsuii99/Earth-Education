        <h1>Welcome to World Earth Day</h1>
        <h2>Celebrate and Protect Our Planet</h2>
        <p>Earth Day is an annual event celebrated around the world on April 22 to demonstrate support for environmental protection. First celebrated in 1970, it now includes events coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network in more than 193 countries. The purpose of Earth Day is to raise awareness about environmental issues and encourage people to take action to protect the planet. It serves as a reminder of the fragility of our environment and the urgent need for collective action to safeguard it for future generations.</p>
        
        <h2>The History of Earth Day</h2>
        <p>The idea for the first Earth Day came from Gaylord Nelson, a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, who was inspired by the anti-war movement and wanted to create a similar energy around environmental issues. The first Earth Day in 1970 brought together millions of people across the United States to protest against environmental degradation and demand change. The event was a huge success and led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the passage of several important environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act.</p>
        <p>Since its inception, Earth Day has evolved significantly. The first Earth Day was primarily focused on raising awareness about pollution and the need for environmental protection. However, as environmental issues have become more complex and interconnected, Earth Day has expanded its focus to include a wide range of topics, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainable development. The event has also grown in scale, with millions of people participating in activities around the globe, from tree planting to educational workshops.</p>

        <h2>Earth Day Around the World</h2>
        <p>Today, Earth Day is celebrated in over 193 countries, making it the largest secular observance in the world. It is a day of action that brings together people of all backgrounds, cultures, and ages to work towards a common goal: protecting our planet. From tree planting and community cleanups to educational events and policy advocacy, Earth Day activities take many forms and are tailored to the needs and challenges of each community.</p>
        <p>In many countries, Earth Day is marked by large-scale events that draw attention to local environmental issues. For example, in India, Earth Day is often celebrated with tree planting drives and awareness campaigns focused on air and water pollution. In Brazil, communities come together to protect the Amazon rainforest, highlighting the importance of biodiversity and the need for sustainable land use practices. In the United States, Earth Day has become synonymous with environmental activism, with numerous organizations hosting rallies, educational events, and community service projects.</p>

        <h2>How to Be More Eco-Friendly</h2>
        <p>Being eco-friendly means living in a way that is not harmful to the environment. Here are some tips on how to be more eco-friendly in your daily life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:</strong> Cut down on what you throw away. Follow the three "R's" to conserve natural resources and landfill space. This means being mindful of the products you buy, opting for those with minimal packaging, and finding ways to reuse items before recycling them. For instance, consider using glass jars for storage instead of buying new containers. You can also repurpose old clothing into cleaning rags or donate items you no longer need instead of discarding them.</li>
            <li><strong>Conserve Water:</strong> Turn off the tap when not in use, fix leaky faucets, and install water-efficient fixtures. Water is a precious resource, and saving water can also reduce your utility bills. Additionally, consider collecting rainwater for gardening and other non-potable uses. Simple actions like taking shorter showers and using a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways can make a significant difference.</li>
            <li><strong>Choose Sustainable Products:</strong> Opt for products made from sustainable materials and that are produced in environmentally-friendly ways. Look for certifications like Fair Trade, USDA Organic, and Energy Star. Supporting companies with sustainable practices encourages more businesses to follow suit. When shopping, consider buying second-hand items or products made from recycled materials.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Energy-Efficient Appliances:</strong> Replace old appliances with energy-efficient models to save electricity and reduce your carbon footprint.
